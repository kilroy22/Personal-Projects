This repository holds all of my personal projects that I've done over the years. Currently they're binned in three different categories

Personal Programming Projects:
Python
Data Science
Machine Learning
Webscraping
Graphs and Maps
Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation.

Background:
Hello!

My name is Justin Kessler and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little bit about me. I completed my undergraduate at Eastern Connecticut State University where I majored in Political Science with an emphasis on mixed-methods research. I began to learn how to code in a course entitled Political Parties & Elections, where we learned about census data, polling, survey methodology, and redistricting. I earned my Master's degree in International Relations with a focus on economic development from Aberystwyth University. The program is currently ranked among the top ten best International Relations programs in the United Kingdon, and among the top twenty in the world. While mixed-methods, this program rounded out my qualitative methods with a focus on interviewing, focus groups, content analysis and ethnographic research. I currently work as a researcher at the SC Johnson College of Business at Cornell University. 

This Github is comprised solely of my personal projects that i have completed from scratch, or from coursework that i have done in the past.
